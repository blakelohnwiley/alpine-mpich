gSpan
=====

gSpan (graph-based substructure pattern mining), which discovers frequent substructures without candidate generation. gSpan builds a new lexicographic order among graphs, and maps each graph to a unique minimum DFS code as its canonical label. Based on this lexicographic order gSpan adopts the depth-first search strategy to mine frequent connected subgraphs efficiently. Our performance study shows that gSpan substantially outperforms previous algorithms, sometimes by an order of magnitude.

REQUIREMENTS:
=====

Java JRE v1.6.0 or later

INSTALLATION:
=====
    - gSpan scpirt has 4 input parameters:
        - inputfile
        - frequency threshold for subnetwork
        - number of nodes in subnetwork, used to restrict the search space
        - number of edges in subnetwork, used to restrict the search space

EXAMPLES:
=====
    - ./gSpan.sh brachypodium-correlation-cutoff-0.98-parsed.lg 1 3 3 #mines brachypodium dataset for subetworks with frequncy of one with 3 nodes and 3 edges. 
    - ./gSpan.sh otu_table_ITS_Soil_Fungi-cleaned-sorenson-0.760000.lg 1 3 3 #mines brachypodium dataset for subetworks with frequncy of one with 3 nodes and 3 edges.
